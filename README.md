# Autoencoder_Image_Denoising
A simple autoencoder for image denoising, written in python using Keras and the MNIST dataset.
Run the program from the Terminal: python autoencoder.py
It will train the Model using MNIST and save the trained Model. The saved model will be loaded the next time it is called to eliminate redundant training.
Also the noised Inputs and denoised Outputs will be displayed using Matplotlib.
